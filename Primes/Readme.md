Changes:

  - lib/:
    - FindPrimes method fixed
    - new FindPrimes method

  - app/:
    - Print method outsourced from lib/src/"primes.cpp" to app/src/main.cpp

  - tests/:
    - new test cases for compering the own result of amount of Primes to n with the real result



Problems:

  - still no dynamic function to get the real amount of Primes to n into a test case but i'm using a hardcoded
    amount result!
